# Engineering Notes

## What is this?
A repository with notes on best practices and opinions I have on a number of
software engineering domains. It will be highly opinionated and there may be
ideas I have here that you don't agree with. If so, let me know and we can
always discuss it. I like to learn and I like to talk system design. I am in
no way an expert and I don't code in my free time, but I would like to think
that I am a half-decent engineer.

## Who are you?
I'm just a guy from New York, who is a software developer by trade. I like math
and I like building things, but I don't write code in my free time. I've never
been a person who wants to automate his whole life and I am not trying to change
the world with these notes.

I've been programming professionally for a few years now, and all of that time
has been in the start-up world so I have seen some shit. I have experience 
writing data pipelines for direct to consumer startups, as well as building
distributed systems and DSL's for fin-tech startups. I have spent a lot of time
reading AWS documentation and a lot more time yelling at my computer while
debugging broken code.

Again, **all opinions here are my own**. I am doing this because my friend Ethan
said that I should. My main goal is to help people who are trying to learn
best practices.

**Fair warning:** The notes I take here will be heavily skewed towards Python;
I currently work at a python shop, but I may bust out Golang or other languages
at certain points. I'll be sure to specify them in my notes when applicable.

## Why should I trust your advice?
You shouldn't. Again, I'm just some guy, but I have some experience with
software development. If you don't like the advice here or find it to be
trivial, then that's fine by me. This is one resource in a sea of resources on
engineering practices, so I don't expect everyone to agree or really believe
that I am the singular source of truth.

What I will do here is talk about practices that _I find_ to be important and
that have helped _me_ grow as an engineer. You may stress other factors in
engineering, and that's ok.

## Why are you doing this?
Because I thought it would be a fun thought exercise, and a way to help others.
It also gives me something to think about over the weekend.
